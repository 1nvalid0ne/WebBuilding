          <h2>What Is This Site?</h2>
        <p>This site is basically the home of everything computer related that I will ever do in my lifetime. Meaning, it's like the hub for my 'code'..... See what I did there? Get it? Code Hub? Eh whatever. So anyways, this site was created on January the
        09th, 2021. That's the day that I started making this here 'beaut.</p>
        <p>My GitHub profile is linked EVERYWHERE! (LITERALLY) That's where us programmers and developers host our stuff. So....check it out! DUH. I didn't link it everywhere so it wouldn't be clicked!</p>
          <h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
        <p>What I do is- I dream about sitting at my desk all day, comfortable, and programming or developing something awesome! That's my life and I love it. My niche is HERE, my desk with my holographic Logitech mouse and keyboard, plus my comfy-cozy mousepad and headset. I listen to Lofi, Metal, or even Russian Hip-Hop while working. (J-POP too) But, today has consisted of Lofi mixes on YouTube. I want to do what I'm doing on this very day, everyday. Personally, the best stuff ever!</p>
          <h2>What Languages Do I Know?</h2>
        <p>I'm glad you asked! Well, as of now (January of 2021) I'm enrolled in a Java course, as you can see by my Git repositories, and I'm learning HTML + CSS on my own. (Selftaught Java too!) I prefer to be self-taught, just because I like the atmosphere of my closet-sized room and, again, my desk.</p>
        <p>I'm currently learning HTML and CSS through a YouTube course by <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwNC5ppZo_dYGVjerQY3xYU" class="credit" target="_blank">'Dani Krossing'</a>, I'd check his stuff out! (It's pretty top quality!) I'm learning Java through my school and BPJ <a href="http://www.bluepelicanjava.com/downloadbook_b3/bpj_textbook_7_0_1.pdf" target="_blank" class="credit">(or Blue Pelican Java)</a> There's a free PDF that you can download directly off the internet. Though it does have a water-mark, it's just as useful. </p>
          <h2>What Does All Of This Mean?</h2>
        <p>In summary, this is all to develop my skills as a designer and programmer. I wish to go into Fullstack development, whether it's under FAANG <br> (facebook, amazon, apple, netflix?, and google) or a smaller company. I love computers so much, and obviously not just for the games, but for the idea that I can create anything by typing things into specialized software while merging 3d and 2d images to make something BEAUTIFUL. All with only draining the resource of time and electricity.</p>
          <h2>Questions? FaQ? Q&A?!</h2>
        <p>Do you have any questions? Or maybe you need to report a BUG! NO, wait, maybe you want me to add something to a page on my website! If any and more, you can visit my <a href="contact.html" class="credit">Contact Page</a> to get your hands of my email and social-medias! Thank you for being on my prized site!</p>
